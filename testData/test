ACADEMIC PROJECTS
DynamoDB (DHT)






Java, Android
Implemented a simplified version of DynamoDB using virtual node for partitioning uniform data and load distribution, chain replication for linearizability, hinted handoff for failure recovery.

Data Mining on Biomedical Data




Java, Python
Designed the schema and  and implemented data warehouse for biomedical data 
Implemented the Apriori algorithm to find all frequent itemsets and association rules and also implemented parser for querying the generated rules
Performed statistical analysis on gene expression to classify new patients (ttest, ftest, pearson correlation)
Implemented various clustering algorithms (KMeans, Hierarchical, Density based, Markov’s graph clustering) and compared their performance using external and internal indexes
Implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forests and Neural Networks algorithms for classification

Handwritten Digits Recognition 




Python
Implemented a multilayer perceptron neural network to classify handwritten digits achieving 93% performance.
Implemented Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines to classify handwritten digits and compare the performance of all three

Classification and Regression




Python
Implemented LDA and QDA to perform classification on sample dataset
Implemented Ridge Regression to perform linear regression with regularization to minimize effect of outliers
Implemented non linear regression by mapping the input features to higher order polynomials

PINTOS operating system
